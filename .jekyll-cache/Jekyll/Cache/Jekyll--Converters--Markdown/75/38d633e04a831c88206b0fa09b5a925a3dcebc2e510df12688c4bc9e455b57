<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Emerald may be installed by simply downloading the .zip folder from the <a href="https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/archive/master.zip">repository on Github</a>.</p>

<p>After extracting the content from the folder into the selected directory, you can type <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> from the terminal, than open your browser to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0:4000/emerald/</code> and you will find it there.</p>

<p>Additionally it is possible to fork the repository and use Github Pages as hosting. By following this way it will be enough to change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code> value into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file, with the directory name of your project (for example /blog) or simply with a ‚Äú/‚Äù (slash) if you want install Emerald in the root.</p>

<p>Last but not least: the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll documentation</a> is the best starting point!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
